// Maby a museam of flufy bouncy dry grass balls that inhabit empty areas. 
// Though that would be a bit of a mouthful. Of course, by the time someone 
// reads this inevitably they will either be personally planning on 
// hidding something in here or someone else will allready have. Such as an
// aircraft hanger, a politicians seedy side or one of those blue monkeys 
// people keep mentioning. I need some of those pills. In any case, please 
// release the hidden aircraft carriers/historys/blue monkeys (delete as 
// appropriate) into the wild, so they may mate and lead fulfilling lives. Just
// don't release the dry grass. It will conquer us all.

// P.S. Whos sadder? Me for writting this or you for reading it? Answers on a
