// We are proud to report that the first honest politican has been created.
// By coliding politicians at high speed in a politician accelerator
// (See trebachet) and tracking the pattern of dishonest politican body parts
// that hit the ground it has been shown that the honest state does in fact
// exist, as a few theorests have long speculated.
// It appears that for 5.46x10^-3 seconds a honest politician is formed, at
// approximatly the moment they realise they are about to die.
// The reversion to a dishonest politician happens moments latter, when they
// realise that they probably deserve it.
