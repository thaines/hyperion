// Stop loitering. If you continue to loiter the police force charged (At great
// expense.) with enforcing the silly crimes will come and arrest you. You will
// be charged and given sumary judgement by a cute lil bunny rabbit. The
// punishment will be death by tounge hanging, you will have a choice of tounge,
// either your own or any president and/or beatnik of your choice. In the event
// the tounge snaps at the hanging you may go free, you may not. It depends.
